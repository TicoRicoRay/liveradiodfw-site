# Live Radio DFW — Project Plan

_Last updated: 2026-04-17 · 1:38 PM Central_

**This file is the session-to-session handoff.** For active defects see [bugs.md](bugs.md). For planned work see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).


## 🚀 Starting a new session

Perplexity threads are disposable. This repo is the durable memory. To get a new agent up to speed fast, paste this as your first message:

> **Band marketing work on Live Radio DFW. Before anything else, read https://github.com/TicoRicoRay/liveradiodfw-site/tree/docs — start with `docs/project-plan.md` (especially "Pick up here next session"), then `docs/bugs.md` (active defects, including Jarvis's own blind spots in the J-series), `docs/roadmap.md` (planned work), and `docs/architecture/scheduled-tasks.md` (every running cron). Skim `docs/architecture/sources-of-truth.md` and `docs/runbooks/`. For band-facing facts (genre, lineup, songs, upcoming shows, positioning, social handles), read the public site at https://www.liveradiodfw.com — that's the source of truth for anything the public sees. Then [today's task].**

**Rules of engagement you should remind the agent of if they slip:**
- Google Calendar is the source of truth for shows. Never hand-edit `shows.json` or `shows/*.html`.
- Venue contacts + negotiations live in **Mailchimp**.
- DNS is on **Cloudflare** (GoDaddy is registrar only).
- **Never read the EOS calendar** — it's personal and unrelated to the band.
- Always say **"Central"** or **"America/Chicago"** — never CDT/CST.
- Fix the foundation before the wall decorations.

## 🔖 Pick up here next session

_Put this at the top so next-session-me reads it first._

**Context:** We spent today (2026-04-17) fixing the sync-wipe bug (non-destructive merge + strict parser), grandfathering "Tickets: Free" into the calendar, moving docs to a `docs` branch on `liveradiodfw-site`, cleaning up the `-marketing` repo, and rewriting the DNS/Pages runbook.

**Top priorities right now:**

1. **B1 - DST-safe sync cron.** See [bugs.md#b1](bugs.md). Ray needs to find the owning thread in Perplexity's scheduled-tasks view.
2. **R1 - Cancel Bandzoogle.** See [roadmap.md#r1](roadmap.md). Legacy domains are already redirected; just needs Bandzoogle Domain Manager cleanup + cancellation.
3. **B2 / R8 - Regina as attendee.** See [bugs.md#b2](bugs.md). Decision pending: manual in GCal UI vs. extending `Code.gs`.
4. **R4 - Wildcard 301s.** See [roadmap.md#r4](roadmap.md). Waiting on Search Console export from Ray.

**New additions (2026-04-17 PM):**
- Bug **B4** logged: the calendar-host identity in docs (`rmyers@futurebright.com` in 4 places) is likely wrong; real canonical should probably be Outlook on `info@liveradiodfw.com`. Intentionally deferred - every calendar change turns into a multi-hour rabbit hole.

**Don't break:**
- The band Google Calendar is the source of truth for shows. Never hand-edit `shows.json` or `shows/*.html`.
- The EOS calendar is NOT band-related. Never touch it. Ever.
- Venue contacts live in **Mailchimp**, not this repo.
- DNS lives in **Cloudflare**, not GoDaddy.
- `liveradiodfw.com` is served from the `gh-pages` branch (with CNAME → `www.liveradiodfw.com`). The `docs` branch is never served.

**Nomenclature:** Always say "Central" / "America/Chicago". Never CDT/CST.

**Ray's pet peeves that matter:**
- "Not EOS" (don't read his EOS calendar looking for band stuff)
- "Fix foundation before wall decorations" (don't add features until the base is solid)
- "We're doing surgery here" (be precise, no guessing)
- Never promise "15 minutes"
